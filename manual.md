# Performance FX Manual

Performance FX is a live audio effects processor for Ableton Move. It provides 32 pressure-sensitive punch-in effects with latching — all controlled from Move's pads, knobs, and buttons.

## Getting Started

Open Performance FX from the **Overtake Modules menu** (Shift+Vol+Jog Click), then select it.

It processes **Move Mix** — the main audio output from Move. Play something on Move, then hold any pad to hear the effect. Press harder for more intensity.

All 32 pads are punch-in FX: hold a pad to activate, release to stop. Shift+hold to latch an FX on.

## Encoders

| Knob | Parameter |
|------|-----------|
| E1 | Repeat Length (free time, shown in ms/s) |
| E2 | Repeat Speed (detent at center = normal; left = slow, right = fast) |
| E3 | Repeat Loop on/off (turn right = on, left = off) |
| E4 | Per-FX param 1 (last touched pad) |
| E5 | Per-FX param 2 (last touched pad) |
| E6 | Per-FX param 3 (last touched pad) |
| E7 | Tilt EQ (center = flat, left = bass boost, right = treble boost) |
| E8 | DJ Filter (center = off, left = low-pass, right = high-pass) |
| Shift+E8 | Global Dry/Wet |

Touch any knob to see its current value on the display. Tap a latched pad to select it for E4-E6 editing without unlatching.

### Per-FX Knob Parameters (E4 / E5 / E6)

Each effect has three dedicated parameters on E4-E6 after touching that pad.
The display always shows the selected pad's own three labels, read from the
DSP, so what you see is what the effect actually implements.

**E6 is not always a wet control.** A wet amount is only given to effects where
blending against the dry signal is a real technique — sends, and parallel
processing. Anything that moves audio in time gets something more useful
instead: the wet signal there is a delayed copy of the dry, so "mixing" the two
comb-filters rather than blends.

**Row 4 — Time/Repeat:**

| Effect | E4 | E5 | E6 |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| RPT 1/4 – RPT TRP | Filter | Gate | Decay |
| STUTTER | Filter | Gate | Decay |
| SCATTER | Pattern | Gate | Reverse |
| REVERSE | Length | Filter | Decay |
| STRETCH | Speed | Filter | — |

Decay fades each successive repetition. STRETCH has no honest third control, so
it declares none rather than carrying a filler knob. SCATTER's Pattern selects
one of five slice orders — Shuffle, Stutter, Interleave, Scramble, Retrograde.

**Row 3 — Filter Sweeps:**

| Effect | E4 | E5 | E6 |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| LP SWP | Speed | Reso | Depth |
| HP SWP | Speed | Reso | Depth |
| BP RISE | Speed | Reso | Depth |
| BP FALL | Speed | Reso | Depth |
| RESO SW | Speed | Reso | Mix |
| PHASER | Depth | Feedback | Mix |
| FLANGER | Depth | Feedback | Mix |
| AUTOFLT | Depth | Reso | Center |

Depth is how far the sweep travels. Blending dry back into a filter sweep just
stops it sweeping, so the plain sweeps get Depth; the three that are classically
used in parallel keep a Mix.

**Row 2 — Space/Delay:**

| Effect | E4 | E5 | E6 |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| DLY 1/4 | Feedback | Tone | Level |
| DLY D8 | Feedback | Tone | Level |
| PP 1/4 | Feedback | Tone | Level |
| PP D8 | Feedback | Tone | Level |
| ROOM | Decay | Tone | Level |
| HALL | Decay | Tone | Level |
| DK VERB | Decay | Tone | Level |
| SPRING | Decay | Tone | Level |

Level is the send amount, and the dry signal always survives underneath it.

**Row 1 — Distortion/Rhythm:**

| Effect | E4 | E5 | E6 |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| CRUSH | Bits | Tone | Mix |
| DWNSMPL | Rate | Tone | Mix |
| SATURATE | Drive | Tone | Mix |
| GATE | Rate | Duty | Depth |
| TREMOLO | Rate | Depth | Shape |
| OCT DN | Pitch | Tone | Mix |
| VINYL | Noise | Warmth | Mix |
| VNL BRK | Rate | Noise | Tone |

GATE's Depth is how far it ducks — the wet amount by its real name. TREMOLO's
Shape morphs its LFO from sine to square; a Mix there would only have
duplicated Depth.

Knobs set the base value and pressure moves it either side of that, so a knob
never takes expression away from the pad.

## Pressure

Each FX responds to pad pressure differently:

- **Repeats**: Pitch drift amount
- **Filter sweeps**: Sweep speed / resonance
- **Phaser/Flanger**: Depth
- **Delays**: Feedback amount
- **Reverbs**: Decay length
- **Bitcrush**: Bit depth
- **Saturate**: Drive amount
- **Tremolo**: Depth
- **Gate**: Gate threshold

## Latching

Any FX can be latched (stays on after release):

- **Shift+Hold pad**: Latch the FX (pad turns red)
- **Shift+Hold latched pad**: Unlatch it
- **Hold pad then press Shift**: Also latches/unlatches

Multiple FX can be latched simultaneously for layered effects. Tap a latched pad (without Shift) to select it for E4-E6 knob editing.

## Buttons

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Jog click** | Tap tempo (tap 2+ times) |
| **Jog turn** | Coarse BPM adjustment (+/- 1 BPM) |
| **Shift+Jog turn** | Fine BPM adjustment (+/- 0.5 BPM) |
| **Undo** (tap) | Toggle bypass on/off |
| **Undo** (hold) | Momentary bypass (bypassed while held) |
| **Back** | Exit |

## Tempo

BPM range: 20–300. Set via tap tempo (Jog click, 2+ taps) or jog wheel turn (coarse) / Shift+Jog turn (fine).

The display header shows current BPM and active FX count.

## Display

The main view shows:
- **Line 1**: "PFX {BPM} [{active count}]"
- **Lines 2-3**: Names of currently active/latched FX (latched marked with *)
- **Line 4**: E1-E4 parameter labels (repeat controls + first per-FX param)
- **Line 5**: E5-E8 parameter labels

When bypassed, a "BYPASSED" overlay appears. Touching a knob or activating an FX shows a temporary overlay with the parameter name and value bar.
